## Progress Report 3 - Prepared 11/14/2020

# Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:
Modified textures and lighting of environment of game

Added basic feature of the game in the form of a rudimentary melee combat system

Began importing assets deemed important to the game


# Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:
Finalization of game mechanics

Testing phase of development

Completion of Demo Videos 1, 2, and 3


# Root Cause of Variances:
The root cause of the variances in this reporting period is, once again, entirely the result of my own time mismanagement. In this particular case, I severely underestimated the amount of time I would need to dedicate to other end-of-semester projects within my other classes when initially scheduling my milestones for this reporting period. The result of this severe underestimation was the trimming back of the planned size of the game, though the core mechanics, such as rudimentary melee combat, the platforming itself, and a basic goal for the game, should still be feasible within the remaining two weeks to complete the project. To be specific, I have changed my plans from developing multiple medium-sized levels, to making a much larger singular level to compensate for the reduction in the number of planned levels. 


# Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:
These variances have had a strong impact on the upcoming milestones, as discussed above, as I have had to change those milestones and the end goals of the project quite a bit more than I would have liked to. Essentially, they have resulted in a significant modification of what the planned milestones actually are, but not their dates. As stated in the other progress reports, the project due date is relatively inflexible by nature, so that remains unaffected by the above variances.


# Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:
Unfortunately, there are very few, if any, preventative actions I can take at this stage in the semester that would provide any real benefit without taking further time away from this project. The only preventative action I can think of would be to work on the other final projects and assignments further in advance, so as to clear a very large time block for this project, that would still push this project further out, and possibly affect its overall feasibility. 

As stated above, my planned corrective action is to reevaluate my existing milestones and make appropriate modifications to them that will allow me to still deliver a functioning game, though one reduced in size from the original plan, by the due dates presented in the course calendar. I have already taken this corrective action, however. 


# Summary of Upcoming Tasks
The upcoming tasks for the coursework include the creation of Demo Videos 1, 2, and 3, and the delivery of the FInal Video Submission, Final GitHub, Most Meaningful Objective Report, and Time Log 10.

Just as before, the specific upcoming tasks for the project itself include modification of the physics, creation of additional geometry and implementation of additional assets, implementation of a new end goal for the single large level, and finally entering the testing phase to receive feedback on the project from a few trusted individuals. 


# Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period
My planned accomplishments for the next reporting period are to finally reach the requisite 180 hours for the project, finish implementing the planned game mechanics, properly expand the singular level into something much larger, and complete the above upcoming tasks. 


# New Risks Identified/Risk
Just as with the two previous progress reports, I was unable to identify any new risks in this reporting period, exactly as predicted in the previous reporting period.


# Issues
The main issues I was able to identify within this reporting period were my own inefficiency and lack of foresight in regards to my work in other classes. Had I made a better evaluation of the amount of time that those other projects would take, I could have more easily worked on both those projects and this one.

# Comments
Being fully honest, I feel extremely disappointed with my own progress at this point in the project. I should certainly have anticipated the amount of time that these end of semester projects in other classes would take, and my failure to do so was nothing short of frustrating. Most of all, I should have performed a much more thorough evaluation of what exactly was involved in the interface design project I have referenced in the past two time logs, as the gap between its opening and its due date should have clearly indicated its potential difficulty and required time investment. My failure to properly gauge that investment and my failure to properly balance progression on that project with assignments in other classes are the primary factors that led to the delay of this senior project, and I am still quite frustrated that I allowed myself to make such a mistake. 

However, I suppose that situation only reinforces the lessons of this course. I would presume that the senior project is at least partially intended to give us all an idea of what working on an actual IT project would be like, and unexpected setbacks due to either carelessness and overlapping deadlines are certainly very realistic conditions to encounter in the professional world. More importantly, it seems partially intended to help us learn how to adapt to such things. Thinking of it in this way has made these errors of mine slightly less frustrating to me, as it refames them as learning experiences, though it does not completely eradicate the sting of my own failures.
